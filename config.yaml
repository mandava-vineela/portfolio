    subtitle: Hey there! Over the three years, I've been working with lots of data, figuring out the important stuff in it. I use tools like Tableau, Power BI, and SQL to make the data easier to understand. I've made reports and charts that show what's happening in a simple way, helping people make better choices using the data. But it's not just about me and numbersâ€”I've also been part of teams. We've used the data together to make things work better for everyone. I like solving data problems and making things run smoothly. My goal is to make data helpful for planning and making things go smoothly!
